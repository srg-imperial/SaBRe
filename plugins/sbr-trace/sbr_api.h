/*
 * Protocol of plugin registration and startup:
 * 1. Loader is passed the path of the plugin (which is ELF Shared Object)
 * 2. Loader uses dlopen() to open the ELF and dlsym() to find sbr_init()
 * 3. Loader calls the sbr_init(), providing following arguments:
 *   a) pointers to argc and argv - both of them will be modified by the
 *      plugin
 *   b) pointer to segfault handler to be populated by the plugin
 *   c) pointer to interception callback registration function to be called by
 *      the plugin
 *   d) pointer to vDSO callback function to be populated by the plugin
 *   e) pointer to syscall handler function to be populated by the plugin
 *
 * Plugin side (in sbr_init()):
 * 4. the plugin parses arguments and leaves them in a state such that when
 *    sbr_init returns, argv[0] is the path of the ELF to be executed and
 *    consecutive arguments are standard arguments passed to the ELF
 * 5. the plugin populates segfault handler with appropriate function (optional)
 * 6. the plugin calls fn_icept_reg for each of the functions that need to be
 *    intercepted
 * 7. the plugin populates vdso_callback with appropriate function (optional)
 * 8. the plugin  populates syscall_handler with appropriate function (required)
 *
 * Loader side:
 * 9. the loader loads the ELF file
 * 10. the loader performs the interception of the functions registered:
 *   a) function is located and first few instructions are relocated to make
 *      room for unconditional jump - pointer to the first function is saved
 *      and an unconditional jump is injected at the end to connect these
 *      instructions to the rest of the function
 *   b) static code is injected that would divert the flow of control through
 *      a pointer returned by the callback (that has to be called with the
 *      pointer of the start of the original function - the first relocated
 *      instruction)
 *   c) the unconditional jump mentioned in a) now jumps to code in b)
 * 11. the loader performs the interception of vDSO if vdso_callback was
 *     populated in a similar way to 10.
 * 12. the loader transfers control to the entry point of the ELF
