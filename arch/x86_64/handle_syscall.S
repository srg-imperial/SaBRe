  # Check for rt_sigreturn(). It needs to be handled specially.
  #
  # When a user registers a signal through rt_sigaction, glibc (or others) add
  # SA_RESTORER and a pointer to inform Linux how to finish a signal execution.
  # SA_RESTORER points to a function that should eventually call the
  # rt_sigreturn syscall (together with whatever teardown stuff). An important
  # point here is that rt_sigreturn doesn't return. SaBRe will replace the
  # syscall with a jump and because our trampoline messes with the stack layout
  # we need to manually handle it. So whenever we are about to call rt_sigreturn
  # we need to revert all custom stack manipulations we did before rt_sigreturn
  # is called.
  #
  # Replacing the SA_RESTORER pointer with a custom handler (e.g. exactly how we
  # do it for SIGSEGV in plugins/varan/signal/proxy.c:overwrite_handler_func) is
  # not an option as the original SA_RESTORER might have some teardown logic
  # that we shouldn't be messing with. On the other hand, we need to replace the
  # SA_RESTORER pointer for signals that SaBRe should be hanlding internally
  # (e.g. SIGSEGV). In this case when a user wants to define a custom SIGSEGV
  # with a custom SA_RESTORER we need to first execute the user's SA_RESTORER
  # and then our own one. In the current version of SaBRe, glibc is used which
  # can simplify various details related to SA_RESTORER.
  #
  # TODO(andronat): Implement SA_RESTORER overwritting. SIGSEGV by default
  # should be pointing to internal's glibc SA_RESTORER. When a user registers
  # a custom one, we need to properly redirect. Assert that our SA_RESTORER will
  # always be a simple one.
